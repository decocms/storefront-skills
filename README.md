# Skills Library for Storefront Agents

The main point of this repo is to provide skills tailored specifically for **storefront**: e-commerce, product showcases, and shopping experiences.

These skills are not generic — they cover SEO, performance, images, sitemap, structured data, and related topics in the context of stores and product pages, so agents can work more precisely in this domain.

## Agents

### SEO
Improves discoverability and indexing of storefront pages for search engines.

- **heading-tags** — Proper use of H1–H6 for hierarchy and keywords on product and category pages.
- **robots** — `robots.txt` rules and directives for crawlers (allow/block, sitemap reference).
- **sitemap** — XML sitemaps for products, categories, and key storefront URLs.
- **structured-data** — Schema.org markup (Product, BreadcrumbList, etc.) for rich results.

### Performance
Keeps storefronts fast and responsive for users and Core Web Vitals.

- **images** — Formats, sizing, lazy loading, and alt text for product and hero images.

### Platforms
Guidance for building or adapting storefronts on specific e-commerce or storefront platforms (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce, custom). No skills yet; placeholder for future platform-specific skills.
